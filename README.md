# PRODIGY_GAI_01
This project fine-tunes the GPT-2 transformer model (developed by OpenAI) on a custom text dataset to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and stylistically consistent text based on user prompts.

**Overview**

GPT-2 is a powerful pre-trained language model capable of generating human-like text. By fine-tuning GPT-2 on your own dataset, the model learns to mimic the style and structure of your data, enabling customized text generation for various applications like storytelling, chatbots, or content creation.

**Features**

-Fine-tuning GPT-2 on any text dataset

-Uses Hugging Faceâ€™s easy-to-use transformers and datasets libraries

-Training with PyTorch backend

-Simple text generation from prompts after training

-Lightweight scripts for training and inference

**Libraries Used**

**Transformers**: Pre-trained model and tokenizer from Hugging Face

**Datasets**: Dataset handling and loading

**PyTorch**: Model training backend



**About**

This project is part of the Prodigy InfoTech Internship Program to demonstrate practical NLP model training and deployment.
